 This project is a Food Delivery Analysis Dashboard created in Power BI
This is an simple practice project in which I have taken data from online platfrom of food delivery.
The dashboard provides a clear view of food delivery data, including order trends over time, most frequently ordered food items, monthly sales patterns, and restaurant performance. The data was first cleaned and prepared in Python and Excel, then imported into Power BI for visualization. where,
Line chart shows order quantity by date.
Pie chart shows  most frequently ordered food items.
Bar chart shows total quantity ordered by month.
Combo chart shows restaurant performance and order quantity across month.

The dashboard highlights key insights such as February and March having the highest order volumes, certain food items dominating overall sales, and monthly variations in both restaurant performance and order quantities.
